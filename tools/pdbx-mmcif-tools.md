   about the 3D structures of proteins, nucleic acids, and complex assemblies. The Worldwide PDB (wwPDB) organization 
   manages the PDB archive and ensures that the PDB is freely and publicly available to the global community. 
   The PDB Exchange Dictionary is used by the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) to define data content for
