description: >
  <p>An internationally-adopted schema for describing geographic information
  and services. It provides information about the identification, the extent, the
  quality, the spatial and temporal schema, spatial reference, and distribution of
  digital geographic data.</p><p>Sponsored by the International Standards Organisation,
  the first edition of ISO 19115 was published in 2003. It has since been split into
  parts: ISO 19115-1:2014 contains the fundamentals of the standard; ISO 19115-2:2009
  contains extensions for imagery and gridded data; and ISO/TS 19115-3:2016 provides
  an XML schema implementation for the fundamental concepts compatible with ISO/TS
  19138:2007 (Geographic Metadata XML, or GMD).</p>
