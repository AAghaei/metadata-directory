description: |
 Protein Data Bank archive (PDB) is the single worldwide archival repository of information about the 3D structures 
 of proteins, nucleic acids, and complex assemblies. The Worldwide PDB (wwPDB) organization manages the PDB archive 
 and ensures that the PDB is freely and publicly available to the global community. The PDB Exchange Dictionary
 is used by the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) to define data content for depositon, annotation and archiving 
 of PDB entries.
