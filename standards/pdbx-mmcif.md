description: |
 Protein Data Bank archive (PDB) is the single worldwide archival repository of information about the 3D structures 
 of proteins, nucleic acids, and complex assemblies. The Worldwide PDB (wwPDB) organization manages the PDB archive 
 and ensures that the PDB is freely and publicly available to the global community. The PDB Exchange Dictionary (PDBx)
 is used by the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) to define data content for deposition, annotation and archiving 
 of PDB entries.  PDBx incorporates the community standard metadata representation, the Macromolecular Crystallographic Information
 Framework (mmCIF),  orginally developed under the auspices of the International Union of Crystallography (IUCr).
 PDBx has been extended by the wwPDB  to include descriptions of other experimental methods that produce 3D macromolecular
 structure  models such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, 3D Electron Microscopy and Tomography.
