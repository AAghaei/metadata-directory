description: |
  <p>NeXus is an effort by an international group of scientists to define a common data exchange format for neutron, X-ray, and muon experiments mainly at user facilities. NeXus is built on top of the container format HDF5 and adds domain-specific rules for organizing data within HDF5 files in addition to a dictionary of well-defined domain-specific field names.</p>
